# Caption3A Application - Session Changelog
**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Session Time:** 12:45 - 12:56  
**Backup Created:** caption3a_backup_20250715_125626

## Overview
This session focused on fixing the production view caption behavior to prevent clearing of finalized captions and ensure proper word preservation in single-line display.

## Key Issues Addressed
1. **Production view clearing captions**: Short phrases were being cleared and replaced instead of accumulating
2. **Words being dropped**: Words near the end of lines were being cut off or dropped
3. **Multi-line display**: Production view was showing multiple lines instead of single line

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Production Caption History System
**File:** `captionStable.py`  
**Lines:** ~668 (global variables section)

**Added:**
```python
production_caption_history = ""  # Store the accumulated production caption text
```

**Purpose:** Maintains accumulated caption text instead of clearing it on each new recognition.

### 2. Modified Production Speech Processing Function
**File:** `captionStable.py`  
**Function:** `process_production_speech_text()`  
**Lines:** 721-791

**Key Changes:**
- **For finalized captions** (`is_recognized=True`):
  - Appends new text to existing history with space separator
  - Uses `textwrap.wrap()` with `break_long_words=False` and `break_on_hyphens=False`
  - Keeps only the last line to maintain single-line display
  - Preserves complete words by preventing word breaking

- **For interim captions** (`is_recognized=False`):
  - Shows history + current interim text for real-time preview
  - Applies same word-preserving wrapping logic
  - Maintains single-line display requirement

### 3. Added History Clearing on Session Start/Stop
**File:** `captionStable.py`  
**Functions:** `start_recognition_endpoint()` and `stop_recognition_endpoint()`

**Added:**
```python
global production_caption_history
# Clear production caption history when starting/stopping recognition
production_caption_history = ""
```

**Purpose:** Ensures clean slate for new sessions and proper cleanup.

### 4. Fixed Function Name Conflict
**File:** `captionStable.py`  
**Function:** `monitor_speech_recognition()` (renamed from `health_check()`)

**Change:** Renamed background monitoring function to avoid conflict with FastAPI endpoint.

## Technical Details

### Word Preservation Logic
- Uses `textwrap.wrap()` with `break_long_words=False` to prevent word breaking
- Uses `break_on_hyphens=False` to prevent hyphenation breaking
- Always keeps the last line (`wrapped_lines[-1]`) to maintain single-line display

### Line Length Management
- Respects `CONFIG.get("max_line_length", 90)` setting
- Automatically removes older text when line exceeds maximum length
- Maintains proper word boundaries during text truncation

### Real-time Updates
- Interim captions show accumulated history + current recognition
- Finalized captions are appended to history
- Both use consistent wrapping logic

## Behavior Changes

### Before This Session:
- ❌ Short phrases cleared previous text
- ❌ Words were dropped/cut off at line boundaries
- ❌ Production view could show multiple lines
- ❌ Inconsistent word preservation

### After This Session:
- ✅ Short phrases stay in place, new captions append
- ✅ All words preserved, no dropping or cutting
- ✅ Production view limited to exactly one line
- ✅ Consistent word-preserving behavior
- ✅ Real-time updates with history

## Files Modified
1. `captionStable.py` - Main application logic
   - Added production caption history system
   - Modified speech processing functions
   - Added session management for history clearing
   - Fixed function naming conflicts

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Short phrase accumulation**: Speak multiple short phrases to verify they accumulate
2. **Long phrase handling**: Speak longer phrases to verify line length management
3. **Word preservation**: Use phrases with long words to ensure no cutting
4. **Session management**: Start/stop recognition to verify history clearing
5. **Real-time updates**: Observe interim vs finalized caption behavior

## Rollback Information
To rollback to previous version:
1. Stop the current application
2. Replace `captionStable.py` with the version from the backup
3. Restart the application

## Notes
- Changes are backward compatible
- User view functionality unchanged
- Translation functionality unchanged
- All existing settings and configurations preserved
